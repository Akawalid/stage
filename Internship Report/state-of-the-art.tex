\section{\scol{Different ways of implementing the problem}}
The list reversal problem has already been proven in two different ways in \textsc{Creusot}, but both methods have certain limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textsc{BOX} method}: This approach models lists using \texttt{Rust Box} type. However, it imposes strong restrictions on the memory model by prohibiting any form of sharing or aliasing, since \texttt{Box} does not support multiple references to the same memory location.
\item \textbf{Memory model method}: This approach consists of passing an object that models the entire memory as a parameter to each method to be verified, therefore, proving requires reasoning over the complete memory state. However, this approach prevents \ccomp{...todo}.
\end{itemize}
